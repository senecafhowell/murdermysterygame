Madonna: “I was taking a shower (and singing, of course) in the bathroom when it supposedly happened. I didn’t hear anything suspicious, so the murder must not have been close to me.”
Janet Jackson: “Well, last night, a group of us were working on solving the Rubik’s cube. I got up to get some water from the kitchen, and I think I heard some music coming from the front of the house. That’s all I’ve got for you, I’m sorry to say.”
Freddie Mercury: “I promise you, mama, I didn’t kill a man last night. I was in the living room with the girls, trying to solve that goshdarn Rubik’s cube.”
Frank Sinatra: “I was just listening to some music in the office. I promise you I most definitely do not know anything else.”
Prince: “I went to bed early last night, so I don’t have anything to tell you. I must’ve been fast asleep when it happened.”
Celine Dion: “Hey, you know what, I noticed a lot of technological-related things- like a mixtape, polaroid camera, and a Walkman- lying around last night. Maybe the murderer used one of those.”
