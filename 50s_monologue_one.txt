Welcome, Detective, to the Golden Age- the 1950s. Full of poodle skirts, drive-in movies, and hula hoops, 
the 1950s had a lot going for it. You have been transported into this decade to solve a very important case. 
In the ranch-style house that stands before you, a murder took place the previous night. 
The case has yet to be solved, so the culprit is still on the loose. 
It is up to you, Detective, to figure out what happened and catch this murderer before it is too late.
