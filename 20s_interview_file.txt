Harry: “It’s not the same as it was… there’s so much violence nowadays. I give you my word, it wasn’t me. I was in the bathroom doing my hair. I’d never dare take a human life.”
Khloé: “I was in the kitchen when it happened, sipping my drink and scrolling through Twitter. So, I don’t really know any specifics, sorry.”
Tom: “Um, no I didn’t do it. I was with Timothée working on a new script he got, so it wasn’t him either.”
Zendaya: “I don’t really know all that much about what happened, but the rumor is the weapon used is associated with those VSCO girls? Quite an interesting choice of a weapon, if you ask me.”
Timothée: “Wait, do you think I did it? You’re crazy! I was rehearsing my lines in the office with Tom, so it wasn’t either of us. I hope you find out who did it.”
Taylor: “I don’t know about you, but I was alone making myself a midnight snack in the kitchen when I heard a really loud thud. So, I think it happened somewhere near where I was.”
