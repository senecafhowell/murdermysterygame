Cicely Tyson: “I was reading a script in the bedroom when I woke up to a ruckus (some spaz the murder was) coming from God knows where. It was loud, though. I don’t have a clue who could’ve done it- besides the fact it wasn’t me, of course. Though, I do vaguely remember hearing someone shout something, in what sounded like a Jersey accent.”
Jane Fonda: “You want the skinny? I didn’t hear too much, but I did speak to a few people today. It seems that it didn’t happen in the front half of the house. That’s all I got.”
Diana Ross: “I was in the entryway when I heard that sound somewhere in the house. I had gone to grab my purse. I didn’t think much of what had happened until I realized a few of the smaller items from my purse had been taken- maybe the murderer stole them?” 
John Travolta: “I was singin’ to myself when it happened, as I went to the bathroom to freshen up. I think that loud noise sounded like some metal clangin’ and some screamin’.”
Elton John: “I had been hanging around with John Lennon, talking about the music biz. Since we were together all night, I can vouch that it was not him”
John Lennon: “Elton and I had been in the living room, discussing matters, when it happened right nearby. But I am confident it wasn’t Elton!"
