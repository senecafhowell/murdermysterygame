Britney Spears: “I was singing my heart out in the bathroom when it happened, so I have got no clue about anything! Although, I heard an anonymous tip that the murder did not take place in a room that’s related to food.”
Paul McCartney: “It wasn’t me or Whitney! We were together in the kitchen when it supposedly happened, discussing music.”
Jennifer Aniston: “I have no idea who did it, or where! I was engrossed in a script when it happened. Although, I do remember, while I was sitting in the living room reading, I heard footsteps pass in the hallway outside, and faint music.”
Leonardo DiCaprio: “Listen, I don’t know what went on last night. I was in the office. I did hear what I think could’ve been the murder really close by to where I was, though.”
Jennifer Lopez: “I don’t know much, as I was in the bedroom sleeping, but I remember taking note that no one who came to the house brought anything super large with them- I think most items that were being carried around were pocket-sized.”
Whitney Houston: “Paul and I were together in the kitchen when it happened. I don’t know too much, but I could’ve sworn I heard someone walking around (not in a room) humming some really famous song- I couldn’t really tell what it was, though, cause whoever it was was not a good singer.”
