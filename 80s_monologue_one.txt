Welcome, Detective, to the “Greed” decade- the 1980s. Full of materialism, amazing media developments, 
and that iconic style, the 1980s had a lot going for it. You have been transported into this decade 
to solve a very important case. In the contemporary-style house that stands before you, 
a murder took place the previous night. The case has yet to be solved, so the culprit is still on the loose. 
It is up to you, Detective, to figure out what happened and catch this murderer before it is too late.
