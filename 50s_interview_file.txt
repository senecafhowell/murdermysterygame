Elvis: “It definitely wasn’t me who did it. I was working on my music in the office all night long.”
Marilyn: “Me and the girls were in the living room last night just chit chatting. It wasn’t me, and it wasn’t any of them, either.”
John: “Hey, man, I don’t have nothing to tell you. I was listening to the football game last night in the bedroom, it couldn’t have been me.”
Brigitte: “I don’t really have much to say that can help you on this. I want to say I heard two guys screaming about football last night, but that could’ve just been the radio. Sorry I can’t be more helpful to you.”
Elizabeth: “Marilyn and Ella and I were talking all night long about everything going on. We didn’t hear anything suspicious, so I really don’t know what to tell you.”
Ella: “I was with the ladies last night… we stayed up all night long so we could talk. I heard some whispers that the murderer used a children’s toy to do it, though. Can you imagine! Of all things, a children’s toy??”
