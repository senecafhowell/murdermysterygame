ABOUT OUR PROJECT:
*************************************
In knowing how iconic "Clue" is in the game world, we decided that we would take on the creation of a game that is based on the beloved "Clue".
In order to make it our own, we added several layers to the game (such as an interact feature, a simple guess feature, decade choices, etc). By doing
this, not only are we making "Clue" more engaging/different, but we're upping the difficulty of the original game, too. It is our hope that the
players of our game find it captures the nostalgic, fun, and mysterious feeling of playing "Clue," while also providing some new, fun surprises!
